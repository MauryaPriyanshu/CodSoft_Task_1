## Project Name: Number Guessing Game
## Description:

The Number Guessing Game is a Java console-based game that generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100). The user is prompted to guess the generated number, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. The game allows for multiple rounds and provides a score based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

## Key Features:

1. Random number generation within a specified range.
2. User input for guessing the number.
3. Feedback on the correctness of the guess.
4. Limit on the number of attempts per round.
5. Option for multiple rounds to play again.
6. Scoring based on the number of rounds won or attempts taken.
